      <description>Introduction Public opinion polls are a crucial part of making sure that democracies work. Understanding the opinions of the public can help guide public policy, help politicians win campaigns, and, as many political scientists note, can help give legitimacy to elections. If polls show a politician losing reelection by 80%, but then they narrowly clinch victory, then voters might call into question whether someone tampered with the results.

      <description>Introduction In this first blog post, I seek to gain a better understanding of past U.S. presidential elections that have taken place after World War Two. This analysis, which will include an exploration of national popular vote margins, state-level margins, and state-level swings, will help guide my first predictive model for the 2024 presidential election and will help seek answers to the following questions:&#xA;How competitive are presidential elections in the United States?</description>
