## Potential Explanations for Inaccuracies
### Hypothesis 1: Incumbency
Did not adequately consider how closely Harris was tied to Biden, should have potentially factored in approval rating.
How do I test?

### Hypothesis 2: Economics
People clearly are still feeling the effects of inflation, and exit polls show that the economy was a top issue and that voters who cited the economy as their top issue swung towards Trump, indicating that GDP was not an accurate indicator of how Americans were viewing the state of the economy. What else should have been used? RDI growth? Inflation indicator? Consumer sentiment?
How do I test?

### Hypothesis 3: Demographics
Won't explain my nationwide miss, but would have helped explain why I missed much more in some states like NJ, NY, FL, and TX than I did in others like WI
How do I test?
